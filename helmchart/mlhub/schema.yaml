    secretToken:
        type: string
        description: |
          A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to secure communications
          between the hub and the configurable-http-proxy.

          ```sh
          # to generate a value, run
          openssl rand -hex 32
          ```

          Changing this value will cause the proxy and hub pods to restart. It is good security
          practice to rotate these values over time. If this secret leaks, *immediately* change
          it to something else, or user data can be compromised

          Creates an image pull secret for you and makes the hub pod utilize
          it, allowing it to pull images from private image registries.
          
          Using this configuration option automates the following steps that
          normally is required to pull from private image registries.
          
          ```sh
          # you won't need to run this manually...
          kubectl create secret docker-registry hub-image-credentials \
            --docker-server=<REGISTRY> \

            --docker-email=<EMAIL> \

                - https://index.docker.io/v1/
                - quay.io

                - abc123SECRETzyx098

              For gcr.io registries the password will be a big JSON blob for a
              Google cloud service account, it should look something like below.
                            
              ```yaml

              This sets the IP address that should be used by the LoadBalancer for exposing the hub service.
              Set this if you want the hub service to be provided with a fixed external IP address instead of a dynamically acquired one.
              Useful to ensure a stable IP to access to the hub with, for example if you have reserved an IP address in your network to communicate with the JupyterHub.

      Additional values to pass to the Hub.
      JupyterHub will not itself look at these,
      but you can read values in your own custom config via `hub.extraConfig`.
      For example:

      ```yaml
      custom:
        myHost: "https://example.horse"
      hub:
        extraConfig:
          myConfig.py: |
            c.MyAuthenticator.host = get_config("custom.myHost")
      ```
